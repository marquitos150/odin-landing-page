This repository contains a simple landing page for TutorMarc, a website where I offer tutoring services to high school and college students in mathematics. The landing page provides an introduction and the subjects I tutor in.

## Reflection
In this project, I have demonstrated a solid understanding of CSS elements while paying close attention to the box model, making sure to incorporate flexbox to arrange and distribute the items effectively. I also learned how to use nested flex containers to control the orientation of items and align elements to achieve the desired layout. While there is still much to learn about CSS, the skills I have gained provide a strong foundation that will help me tackle more complex webpages with confidence."
